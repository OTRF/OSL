<h2>How do I become a Translator?</h2>

<p>Whether you want to collaborate just once or on a regular basis, ask to join the Github team for an existing language by creating an issue in its repository on Github with the <span style="background-color: #fcabc7; color:white;"><strong>team request</strong></span> tag. Translations will be uploaded once a pull request is made.</p>

<h2>How do I become a Reviewer?</h2>

<p>To become a reviewer you have to be a collaborator on a regular basis first. Request to become a reviewer to the project’s coordinators. If you find a typo or minor error you can submit a new issue with the <span style="background-color: #d73a4a; color:white;"><strong>error</strong></span> tag.</p>

<h2>How do I become a Coordinator?</h2>

<p>We’re in an initial stage of the project so we’re not taking requests for coordinating the space yet.</p>

<h2>Are there any resources to help with translations?</h2>

Of course! Refer to $APENDICE$

<h2>How do I propose a resource to translate?</h2>

<p>Open a new issue with the <span style="background-color: #58d369; color:white;"><strong>translation proposal</strong></span> and <span style="background-color: #008672; color:white;"><strong>help wanted</strong></span> tags. Remember that resources must be open source, be under any Creative Commons license, but NoDerivs or count with the author’s explicit authorization if private.</p>

<p>The issue must contain the following information:</p>
<p>Title with the following format: [Original Language ISO639-1 code] Title. E.g. “[EN] The Githubification of Infosec”</p>
<ul>
	<li>Author</li>
	<li>Link to the original document</li>
	<li>A tag indicating the language of the original resource</li>
</ul>

<h2>How do I request a new language?</h2>
<p>Just open a new issue with the <span style="background-color: #1b4c84"><strong>language request</strong></span> tag. It will be taken care of as soon as possible.
Bear in mind that you must contribute with at least one translation before opening a new language to the space.</p>

<p>I’m an author of private content and I’m willing to share with the community, how can I reach you?
Just follow the same procedure to propose a resource to translate.</p>

<h2>I’m an author of private content and someone translated my content withouth my consent, how do I report it?</h2>

<p>We will work hard for this not to happen. In case it does, you can contact the project coordinators or send an email to the OTR account.</p>
